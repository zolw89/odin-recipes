    <p>It attacks your taste buds! Spicy chorizo-style sausage and lean ground turkey combine to make a kick-butt burger that's full of taste but won't leave you feeling stuffed. This burger could also be grilled outdoors for a smokier flavor. Goes great with a michel ada or frozen margarita.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground turkey</li>
        <li>4 links Mexican chorizo sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buttery spread</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup mayonnaise, divided
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Combine ground turkey, chorizo, garlic, onion powder, chipotle flakes, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well-blended. Shape into 4 loosely-packed patties.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat until hot; grease with buttery spread. Place patties on the griddle; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Flip patties and cook until browned on the second side, about 6 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Top each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.</p>
    </ol>
